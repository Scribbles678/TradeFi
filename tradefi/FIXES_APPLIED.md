# TradeFI Dashboard - Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Aster DEX Not Showing Balance**
**Problem:** The dashboard was looking for `ASTER_API_KEY` and `ASTER_API_SECRET` but your `.env` file has `APEX_API_KEY` and `APEX_API_SECRET`.

**Fix:** Updated `nuxt.config.ts` to use the correct environment variable names:
```typescript
// Changed from:
asterApiKey: process.env.ASTER_API_KEY,
asterApiSecret: process.env.ASTER_API_SECRET,

// To:
asterApiKey: process.env.APEX_API_KEY,
asterApiSecret: process.env.APEX_API_SECRET,
```

### 2. **OANDA 404 Error (Double Slash)**
**Problem:** OANDA API was getting 404 errors due to double slashes in the URL (`https://api-fxpractice.oanda.com//v3/accounts`).

**Fix:** Added URL cleaning logic in `server/api/balance/oanda.ts`:
```typescript
// Ensure baseUrl doesn't end with slash to avoid double slashes
const cleanBaseUrl = baseUrl.endsWith('/') ? baseUrl.slice(0, -1) : baseUrl
const response = await $fetch<OandaResponse>(`${cleanBaseUrl}/v3/accounts/${accountId}`, {
```

### 3. **Dynamic Portfolio Description**
**Problem:** "Across all exchanges" text didn't change when filtering by asset class.

**Fix:** Added dynamic text that changes based on selected filter:
- "All" ‚Üí "Across all exchanges"
- "Forex" ‚Üí "OANDA Forex only"
- "Crypto" ‚Üí "Aster DEX Crypto only"
- "Options" ‚Üí "Tradier Stocks/Options only"

### 4. **Balance Filtering**
**Problem:** Total Portfolio value wasn't filtering when selecting specific asset classes.

**Fix:** Updated `loadBalances()` function to filter balances based on selected asset class and recalculate totals.

## üéØ Current Status

Your dashboard should now show:
- ‚úÖ **Tradier balance** (was already working)
- ‚úÖ **Aster DEX balance** (should work now with APEX credentials)
- ‚úÖ **OANDA balance** (should work now with fixed URL)
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic filtering** by asset class
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic descriptions** that change with filters

## üß™ Test Your Dashboard

1. **Open http://localhost:3001** in your browser
2. **Check the main dashboard:**
   - Total Portfolio should show combined balance from all 3 exchanges
   - Click "Forex" filter ‚Üí should show only OANDA balance
   - Click "Crypto" filter ‚Üí should show only Aster DEX balance
   - Click "Options" filter ‚Üí should show only Tradier balance
   - Click "All" filter ‚Üí should show combined balance

3. **Check the Account page:**
   - Should show individual balances for all 3 exchanges
   - Should show connection status for each exchange

## üîç If Still Having Issues

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for any error messages that might indicate:
- API authentication failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Missing environment variables

### Test Individual APIs
You can test these endpoints directly:
- `http://localhost:3001/api/balance/aster` - Should return Aster DEX balance
- `http://localhost:3001/api/balance/oanda` - Should return OANDA balance  
- `http://localhost:3001/api/balance/tradier` - Should return Tradier balance
- `http://localhost:3001/api/balances` - Should return all balances combined

### Verify Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file has:
```env
APEX_API_KEY=your_apex_key
APEX_API_SECRET=your_apex_secret
OANDA_API_KEY=your_oanda_key
OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID=101-001-28692540-001
TRADIER_TOKEN=your_tradier_token
TRADIER_ACCOUNT_ID=VA55402267
```

## üéâ Expected Results

After these fixes, your dashboard should display:
- **Real account balances** from all 3 exchanges
- **Filtered totals** when selecting specific asset classes
- **Dynamic descriptions** that change with the selected filter
- **No more $0.00** for Aster DEX and OANDA

The main issue was that your environment variables use `APEX_` prefix instead of `ASTER_` prefix, and the OANDA URL had a trailing slash causing double slashes in the API call.
